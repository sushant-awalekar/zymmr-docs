# Project

Project can be defined as a collection of task that need to be completed to achieve a certain outcome. In Zymmr, a project can be thought of as a container used to organize and track those tasks, or work-items, across the entire team.

A project is simply a collection of issues (stories, bugs, tasks, etc). You would typically use a project to represent the development work for a product.

### Scrum, Kanban, or Bug tracking? 

Scrum has an iteration-based approach, which is generally a good fit for teams developing products, particularly if your team is releasing new versions on a regular schedule. 

Kanban is better suited for a continuous flow of work (e.g. service-oriented teams), where its constraint-based approach helps prevent your team from being overloaded.

Bug tracking delivers a basic workflow for tracking new features and bugs.
